1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:03,909 
The N’Zeer are truth.  

2
00:00:03,909 --> 00:00:08,460 
Hello agents I am Susan Moyer and this is ingress report

3
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:11,660 
I’m on the ground of Ultret the site of one of the largest anomaliess in ingress history

4
00:00:11,660 --> 00:00:16,330 
months of planning and operations around
the globe have led up to this climatic weekend

5
00:00:16,330 --> 00:00:19,820 
with factions neck-to-neck
to control

6
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:23,419 
and the outcome of Jahan outreach to the N’zeer

7
00:00:23,419 --> 00:00:25,789 
as well as the fate of Niantic researcher Stein Lightman

8
00:00:25,789 --> 00:00:30,749 
everything rest what will unfold today
today began in Tohoku when 5000 agents rose to face the challenge before them
 

12
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:54,820 
the action at the primary site was supported by

13
00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:57,060 
thousands of agents in Jarkata and Perth

14
00:00:57,060 --> 00:01:00,520 
as well as in 10 connected cell across the region

24
00:02:08,350 --> 00:02:13,070 
the enlightened dominated both Perth and Tohoku by creating a series of massive fields

25
00:02:13,070 --> 00:02:15,170 
in tohoku

26
00:02:15,170 --> 00:02:18,830 
the resistance attempted to fight back
using dense cluster of links 

27
00:02:18,830 --> 00:02:30,770 
but were overwhelmed by the enlightened fields

28
00:02:30,770 --> 00:02:33,770 
well I am originally from San Fransisco in united states

29
00:02:33,770 --> 00:02:38,810 
but right now I live in Tokyo

30
00:02:38,810 --> 00:02:41,240 
?? here is amazing like I just

31
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:42,210 
moved from Nagoya 

32
00:02:42,210 --> 00:02:45,930 
and it was good there but in Tokyo it is just everyday action 

33
00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:50,060 
in Jakarta it was the enlightened who leveraged link 
34
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:53,660 
and anchored field around the anomaly site to maintain control

35
00:02:53,660 --> 00:03:06,990 
the 10 connected cells were evenly split
5:5

44
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:38,569 
Yes i heard about tsunami before from when i was 11th grade in high school 

49
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:52,400 
there is a tsunami and we fund raised because i was in the community
service club

50
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:59,200 
so we fund raised all the money  and we even sent a group of students here to help

53
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:19,200 
the enlightened captured Jakarta 410 to 239

54
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:22,820 
Perth 590 to 116

55
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:27,390 
and the primary site Tohoku 2,524

56
00:04:27,390 --> 00:04:31,060 
to 1,358 

57
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:37,440 
Persepolis Tohoku was  controlled by the enlightened
4,000 to 2,213

58
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:41,010 
as the anomaly there came to an end the enlightened claimed a critical first victory

60
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:48,820 
just hours later agents in ultret pick up the torch 
continuing the struggle for Persepolis

61
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:53,140 
with unwavering intensity the effort
was supported by massive of agents in 

62
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:53,930 
xx xx xx

63
00:04:53,930 --> 00:04:57,550 
and 10 regional cells connected to this anomaly 

64
00:04:57,550 --> 00:05:01,260 
while the resistance covered both xx and xx with strategic fields

65
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:05,280 
the enlightened leveraged links and anchored fields 

66
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:13,700 
to surge ahead

67
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:18,090 
being to Germany Monaco into
Switzerland Berne

68
00:05:18,090 --> 00:05:23,150 
and even in Florence missing the balkan
really really fun its

69
00:05:23,150 --> 00:05:30,340 
really good reason to playing Ingress to
participate 

70
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:33,870 
I met a lot of new people and

71
00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:36,560 
all the activities I enjoyed so much


74
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:52,629 
I'm a team leader for the resistance

75
00:05:52,629 --> 00:05:55,979 
and I hope we win today like me do it
Brussels??

76
00:05:55,979 --> 00:05:59,960 
and ??

77
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:03,009 
stop me

78
00:06:03,009 --> 00:06:06,300 
the right side green and I

79
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:09,789 
level up and joined the community

80
00:06:09,789 --> 00:06:12,909 
and for me personally 

81
00:06:12,909 --> 00:06:16,960 
I need first this level 16

82
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:20,710 
in xx the tables were turned

83
00:06:20,710 --> 00:06:23,969 
wear resistance ground of disrupted in
like two strategic

84
00:06:23,969 --> 00:06:29,129 
field in the primary cited you track the
resistance dominated the anomaly

85
00:06:29,129 --> 00:06:32,469 
site effectively countering effort by
the unlicensed

86
00:06:32,469 --> 00:06:35,900 
to gain advantage with what has become
known as the back

87
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:47,449 
or speak over minted field

88
00:06:47,449 --> 00:06:49,309

and Liverpool 904 to 375

105
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:06,530 
the resistance took postman 1,092

106
00:08:06,530 --> 00:08:10,060 
to 714 and the primary site at you track

107

4,240 the 1,498 Persepolis

108
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:19,610 
you track it belongs to the resistance 7
2009

109
00:08:19,610 --> 00:08:24,090 
to 3,720 7 when the final measurements
truck

110
00:08:24,090 --> 00:08:27,730 
the resistance claimed you fact but the
day was not yet over

111
00:08:27,730 --> 00:08:31,420 
across the Atlantic important thousand
the fatal

112
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:37,510 
on the ground PDF battle through to the
end first

113
00:08:37,510 --> 00:08:43,880 
the

114
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:53,060 
the

have their fought hard to get

117
00:08:58,069 --> 00:09:02,310 
point we're not gonna stop clue having
at least partially recovered from her

118
00:09:02,310 --> 00:09:04,279 
traumatic mental separation from

119
00:09:04,279 --> 00:09:07,629 
ada within a 10 all the mall

120
00:09:07,629 --> 00:09:14,730 
court anomaly well filed

121
00:09:14,730 --> 00:09:17,740 
if its agreement load up

122
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:20,759 
but mainly we gonna concentrate on the
volatiles

123
00:09:20,759 --> 00:09:31,699 
by

124
00:09:31,699 --> 00:09:32,249 
when the

125
00:09:32,249 --> 00:09:35,350 
when I first signed up a my favorite
colors range from

126
00:09:35,350 --> 00:09:38,779 
I'll on those as the before I got into
the

127
00:09:38,779 --> 00:09:50,839 
here like right one up

128
00:09:50,839 --> 00:09:54,160 
pollen with supported by agent in Fort
Collins Milwaukee

129
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:59,720 
Nashville and the 10 connected cell the
resistance surged early in milwaukee

130
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:04,200 
throwing a large number link I could
feel creating a leak that lasted through

131
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:04,899 
the anomaly

132
00:10:04,899 --> 00:10:08,320 
percent asunder I've been going to at
least one event every

133
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:11,760 
an ongoing series arm and

134
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:27,089 
a yeah it's just you know we're loving
earth by as they come in today hope

135

pretty good I'm in the box below as well

136
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:36,579 
I like that I

137
00:10:36,579 --> 00:10:40,550 
in nashville in like 10 strategic feel
come at the site during the first key

138
00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:43,259 
measurement but a resistance special the
ground

139
00:10:43,259 --> 00:10:47,100 
using LinkedIn and get field return
control at the site to them for the

140
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:48,089 
final measurements

141
00:10:48,089 --> 00:11:02,459 
Ghana dope

142
00:11:02,459 --> 00:11:08,800 
observed

143
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:13,100 
I up

144
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:16,100 
on keep

145
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:21,210 
yet 15 seconds test

146
00:11:21,210 --> 00:11:24,620 
type

147
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:34,240 
so far it's a lot more intense fired

148
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:53,660 
truck map to not only told

149
00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:57,440 
in Fort Collins important be enlightened
held the ground past

150
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:01,060 
they also maintain strategic feel cover
over Portland for the duration of the

151
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:06,630 
anomaly

152
00:12:06,630 --> 00:12:11,120 
has been had about hi going travelling
idealized LA

153
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:20,310

lightning shot make that final jump
through the portal network

181
00:14:07,670 --> 00:14:12,459 
in the end in like his plane to Portland
but would it be enough

182
00:14:12,459 --> 00:14:15,860 
and how would this anomaly effect clue
his last appearance

183
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:18,929 
at an anomaly in Portland following
abrasion time zero

184
00:14:18,929 --> 00:14:23,499 
led to a radical shift in her
personality I kinda scares me now

185
00:14:23,499 --> 00:14:30,680 
feel fine today how about tomorrow what
the next week

00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:44,530 
she's just getting warmed up much at the
final outcome would rest on the actions

190
00:14:44,530 --> 00:14:45,860 
agents around the world

191
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:48,940

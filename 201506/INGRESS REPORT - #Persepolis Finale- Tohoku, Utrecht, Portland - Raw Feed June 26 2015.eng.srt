1
00:00:00,217 --> 00:00:01,879
The N'Zeer are truth.

2
00:00:03,221 --> 00:00:06,677
Hello agents I am Susan Moyer and this is the Ingress report

3
00:00:06,906 --> 00:00:11,764
I'm on the ground of Utrecht the site of one of the largest anomalies in Ingress history

4
00:00:11,859 --> 00:00:16,909
months of planning and operations around
the globe have led up to this climactic weekend

5
00:00:17,037 --> 00:00:19,916
with factions neck-to-neck
to control

6
00:00:20,109 --> 00:00:22,747
and the outcome of Jahan outreach to the N'zeer

7
00:00:22,902 --> 00:00:26,160
as well as the fate of Niantic researcher Stein Lightman XXXXX

8
00:00:26,163 --> 00:00:28,797
everything rest what will unfold today

9
00:00:29,086 --> 00:00:34,744
today began in Tohoku when nearly 5000 agents rose to face the challenge before them

10
00:00:52,678 --> 00:00:57,650
the action at the primary site was supported by thousands of agents in Jarkata and Perth

11
00:00:57,348 --> 00:01:00,286
as well as in 10 connected cell across the region

12
00:02:08,677 --> 00:02:13,919
the enlightened dominated both Perth and Tohoku by creating a series of massive fields

13
00:02:13,951 --> 00:02:19,289
in tohoku the resistance attempted to fight back
using dense cluster of links

14
00:02:19,316 --> 00:02:21,739
but were overwhelmed by the enlightened fields

15
00:02:30,679 --> 00:02:33,829
well I am originally from San Fransisco in united states

16
00:02:34,097 --> 00:02:35,629
but right now I live in Tokyo

17
00:02:39,229 --> 00:02:42,799
?? here is amazing like I just moved from Nagoya

18
00:02:42,943 --> 00:02:47,439
and it was good there but in Tokyo it is just everyday action

19
00:02:47,771 --> 00:02:50,413
in Jakarta it was the enlightened who leveraged link

20
00:02:50,478 --> 00:02:53,859
and anchored field around the anomaly site to maintain control

21
00:02:54,698 --> 00:02:57,865
the 10 connected cells were evenly split
5:5

22
00:03:38,251 --> 00:03:43,032
Yes i heard about tsunami before from when i was 11th grade in high school

23
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:49,426
there is a tsunami and we fund raised because i was in the community
service club

24
00:03:49,459 --> 00:03:54,221
so we fund raised all the money  and we even sent a group of students here to help

25
00:04:15,038 --> 00:04:19,356
the enlightened captured Jakarta 410 to 239

26
00:04:19,383 --> 00:04:22,992
Perth 590 to 116

27
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:29,869
and the primary site Tohoku 2,524 to 1,358

28
00:04:29,974 --> 00:04:37,716
Persepolis Tohoku was  controlled by the enlightened
4,024 to 2,213

29
00:04:38,078 --> 00:04:42,926
as the anomaly there came to an end the enlightened claimed a critical first victory

30
00:04:43,289 --> 00:04:46,745
just hours later agents in ultret pick up the torch

31
00:04:47,004 --> 00:04:50,628
continuing the struggle for Persepolis with unwavering intensity

32
00:04:50,852 --> 00:04:55,534
the effort was supported by massive of agents in xx xx xx

33
00:04:55,591 --> 00:04:58,333
and 10 regional cells connected to this anomaly

34
00:04:58,529 --> 00:05:02,671
while the resistance covered both xx and xx with strategic fields

35
00:05:02,783 --> 00:05:07,349
the enlightened leveraged links and anchored fields to surge ahead

36
00:05:14,814 --> 00:05:18,269
being to Germany Monaco XXX
Switzerland Berne

37
00:05:18,576 --> 00:05:20,937
and even in Florence missing the balkan
really really fun

38
00:05:22,726 --> 00:05:26,441
it's really a good reason to playing Ingress to
participate

39
00:05:30,321 --> 00:05:32,498
I met a lot of new people and

40
00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:37,597
all the activities I enjoyed so much

41
00:05:49,128 --> 00:05:52,806
I'm a team leader for the resistance

42
00:05:53,138 --> 00:05:57,090
and I hope we win today like we used to do it
Brussels?? and ??

43
00:06:02,379 --> 00:06:06,091
the right side green and then

44
00:06:06,388 --> 00:06:10,037
level up and joined the community

45
00:06:11,426 --> 00:06:13,143
and for me a personal wish is

46
00:06:13,397 --> 00:06:15,935
I need bursters level 16

47
00:06:18,968 --> 00:06:20,943
in xx the tables were turned

48
00:06:21,083 --> 00:06:24,588
where resistance ??? disrupted enlightened strategic field

49
00:06:24,879 --> 00:06:29,672
in the primary site ultrect the resistance dominated the anomaly site

50
00:06:29,896 --> 00:06:32,797
effectively countering effort by the enlightened

51
00:06:32,822 --> 00:06:36,095
to gain advantage with what has become
known as the back

52
00:06:36,119 --> 00:06:38,065
or big augmented field

53
00:06:47,888 --> 00:06:49,515
I'm very happy that I'm here

54
00:06:49,609 --> 00:06:54,836
with my friends and next time I'll go on the primary anomalies for this atmosphere

55
00:06:54,982 --> 00:06:58,325
I used to be at a satelite site

56
00:06:58,619 --> 00:07:07,390
I never been to a primary and now I know how amazing it is

57
00:07:09,422 --> 00:07:12,780
well, for me it was lovely because I am a trip

58
00:07:12,956 --> 00:07:15,815
from Utrect so I just go to look around

59
00:07:15,849 --> 00:07:19,980
and see all those people running around playing in my hometown

60
00:07:20,126 --> 00:07:22,580
that was that was marvelous because

61
00:07:22,872 --> 00:07:30,301
you just saw people from all over europe even outside having
fun discovering how beautiful our city is

62
00:07:36,109 --> 00:07:43,082
with 4240 to 1498

63
00:07:43,155 --> 00:07:46,730
The Utrect was captured by the Resistance!

64
00:07:50,097 --> 00:07:54,549
the resistance also dominated the connected cells
claiming nine of the 10th

65
00:07:54,645 --> 00:07:59,195
the enlightened took Helsinki 511 to 402

66
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:02,770
and Liverpool 904 to 375

67
00:08:02,771 --> 00:08:08,184
the resistance took poznan 1,092 to 714 

68
00:08:08,276 --> 00:08:14,566
and the primary site of Utrecht 4,240 to 1,498

69
00:08:14,871 --> 00:08:22,282
Persepolis Utrecht belongs to the resistance 7009 to 3,727

70
00:08:22,491 --> 00:08:24,410
when the final measurements struck

71
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:27,887
the resistance claimed utrecht but the
day was not yet over

72
00:08:28,011 --> 00:08:31,489
across the Atlantic in portland thousand of agents

73
00:08:31,778 --> 00:08:34,304
???on the ground ??? this battle through to the
end

74
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:56,666
you've never been here before if you have you know what to do

75
00:08:56,716 --> 00:08:58,813
we fought hard to get to this point

76
00:08:58,841 --> 00:09:00,456
we're not gonna stop

77
00:09:00,538 --> 00:09:05,616
clue having at least partially recovered from her traumatic mental separation
from ada within a ????

78
00:09:05,647 --> 00:09:09,443
this may will be the most important anomaly of all

79
00:09:15,968 --> 00:09:18,147
if its green load up????

80
00:09:18,212 --> 00:09:20,578
but mainly we gonna concentrate on the
volatiles

81
00:09:32,065 --> 00:09:35,127
when I... when I first signed up a my favorite color is green

82
00:09:35,208 --> 00:09:36,928
so I thought ok I'll go with that

83
00:09:37,057 --> 00:09:38,065
that sound's a good reason

84
00:09:38,651 --> 00:09:39,426
the more I go into the story

85
00:09:39,429 --> 00:09:41,216
the more I think the enlightened is the right way to go

86
00:09:51,047 --> 00:09:55,002
Portland was supported by agent in Fort
Collins Milwaukee Nashville

87
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,499
and the 10 connected cell 

88
00:09:57,254 --> 00:09:59,891
the resistance surged early in milwaukee

89
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:02,324
throwing a large number of links and anchored fields

90
00:10:02,679 --> 00:10:05,106
creating a leak that lasted through the anomaly

91
00:10:05,281 --> 00:10:09,474
since the ???asunder I've been going to at
least one event every anomaly series

92
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:14,210
yes it's just you know we're love ingress

93
00:10:25,215 --> 00:10:26,537
are you excited by today? how do you feel?

94
00:10:27,647 --> 00:10:30,564
pretty good I'm ready to blow some blue.

95
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:32,556
good, I like that

96
00:10:36,233 --> 00:10:41,342
in nashville enlightened strategic fields
covered the site during the first two measurements 

97
00:10:41,747 --> 00:10:43,299
but resistance push on the
ground

98
00:10:43,864 --> 00:10:44,965
using links and anchored fields 

99
00:10:45,394 --> 00:10:48,295
returned control of the site to them for the final measurements

100
00:10:55,130 --> 00:10:55,672
Which to win?

101
00:10:55,799 --> 00:10:56,930
Enlightened!

102
00:10:57,049 --> 00:10:57,919
Which to win?

103
00:10:58,005 --> 00:10:59,023
Resistance!

104
00:11:16,172 --> 00:11:19,081
yet 15 seconds to XXX

105
00:11:24,816 --> 00:11:26,263
so far it's a lot more intense

106
00:11:53,486 --> 00:11:57,474
in Fort Collins and Portland the enlightened
held the ground fast

107
00:11:57,538 --> 00:12:01,870
they also maintain strategic field cover
over Portland for the duration of the anomaly

108
00:12:06,862 --> 00:12:10,035
I have been ??? doing the best in going and travelling
I do like traveling

109
00:12:10,143 --> 00:12:13,547
I have been to many of the states XXXXXXX

110
00:12:20,324 --> 00:12:24,476
we are players from Washington ??all over again??

111
00:12:25,062 --> 00:12:28,861
and we do a lot of really need activities

112
00:12:29,042 --> 00:12:31,958
we've got XXXXXfirstXXX whenever I heard an anomaly

113
00:12:39,781 --> 00:12:44,115
alright the special operation is a team build around america around the world

114
00:12:44,126 --> 00:12:48,044
to build better people bring people
together just like ingress does

115
00:12:48,108 --> 00:12:53,277
to gather team on match I wanna say thank you to every
participant who was in our band today

116
00:12:53,299 --> 00:12:59,002
Oh yeah,I I want a Goruck rucksack for our tracker

117
00:12:59,057 --> 00:13:00,852
, have been to New Zealand I've
played in Australia

118
00:13:01,987 --> 00:13:04,680
I played all the way alike from Europe
through the US

119
00:13:04,935 --> 00:13:06,773
zip car gonna be great for our ingress
run

120
00:13:07,018 --> 00:13:12,299
I won the ingress one year's worth of Hint
water, pretty sweet.

121
00:13:12,329 --> 00:13:14,367
Portland was captured by

122
00:13:16,406 --> 00:13:17,558
The Enlightened

123
00:13:21,666 --> 00:13:24,530
The Enlightened took nine of the 10 Connected cells

124
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:28,702
FortCollins 952 to 136

125
00:13:28,790 --> 00:13:34,732
the resistance captured Milwaukee 1476 to 335 

126
00:13:34,743 --> 00:13:38,963
and Nashville 640 to 578 

127
00:13:39,023 --> 00:13:45,917
the enlightened controlled the
primary site Portland 1,376 to 844

128
00:13:46,034 --> 00:13:54,567
Persepolis Portland was captured by the enlightened 4141 to 3196

129
00:13:54,668 --> 00:13:57,347
as the clock struck 10 p.m. Pacific time

130
00:13:57,572 --> 00:14:00,421
the persepolis anomaly reached its
conclusion

131
00:14:00,576 --> 00:14:03,605
guided by vigilant agents from both factions

132
00:14:03,775 --> 00:14:07,634
the lightman shards make that final jump
through the portal network

133
00:14:08,646 --> 00:14:12,137
in the end the enlightened claimed Portland
but would it be enough

134
00:14:12,274 --> 00:14:14,850
and how would this anomaly affect clue

135
00:14:14,927 --> 00:14:19,068
his last appearance at an anomaly in Portland following
operation time zero

136
00:14:19,078 --> 00:14:21,645
led to a radical shift in her
personality. 

137
00:14:21,872 --> 00:14:23,628
I kinda of scares me you know

138
00:14:24,326 --> 00:14:28,051
I feel fine today you know what about tomorrow what
the next week

139
00:14:30,425 --> 00:14:31,563
I don't trust her

140
00:14:34,411 --> 00:14:37,000
I feel scared for my friends in both
factions because

141
00:14:38,372 --> 00:14:40,491
that we know what you're capable of and I feel like

142
00:14:40,589 --> 00:14:41,918
she's just getting warmed up

143
00:14:41,945 --> 00:14:45,883
much at the final outcome would rest
on the actions of agents around the world

144
00:14:45,931 --> 00:14:49,610
in dozens of countries who battled 24/7 for weeks

145
00:14:49,723 --> 00:14:51,889
on aim to control the lightman shards

146
00:14:52,345 --> 00:14:55,486
during persepolis we featured sitreps from dozens of countries

147
00:14:55,486 --> 00:14:59,048
including Malaysia Egypt France and Romania among others.

148
00:14:59,053 --> 00:15:05,395
more stories of heroic feats ???surface??? daily testifying to
the passions of ingress agents around the world

149
00:15:05,401 --> 00:15:08,939
find these epic sitreps on G plus and
facebook

150
00:15:08,941 --> 00:15:11,121
using the hashtag #Lightmanshards.

151
00:15:11,828 --> 00:15:15,833
in the end the lightning shards traveled over
three hundred and forty thousand kilometers

152
00:15:15,894 --> 00:15:17,938
touching every corner of the globe

153
00:15:18,450 --> 00:15:26,387
the enlightened captured shard number
2 10 14 31 32 33 34 36 and 41

154
00:15:26,391 --> 00:15:30,571
the resistance captured shard number
 9 17 and 39

155
00:15:30,579 --> 00:15:34,576
in total the enlightened captured nine lightman
shards

156
00:15:34,579 --> 00:15:36,462
while the resistance captured three

157
00:15:37,357 --> 00:15:38,964
in the end though it was not enough

158
00:15:39,111 --> 00:15:43,542
despite capturing more shards and controlling Tohoku and Portland

159
00:15:43,677 --> 00:15:47,682
the enlightened were edged out by the
massive resistance victory in Utrecht

160
00:15:47,730 --> 00:15:50,855
the persepolis anomaly series was captured
by

161
00:15:51,021 --> 00:15:52,576
the resistance

162
00:15:52,582 --> 00:15:56,754
Ah

163
00:15:56,802 --> 00:15:59,741
the overall Persepolis series was captured
by the resistance

164
00:15:59,798 --> 00:16:05,639
22,575 to 22,146

165
00:16:05,868 --> 00:16:09,116
by controlling Persepolis they have also
won the allegiance 

166
00:16:09,185 --> 00:16:12,294
of Niantic researchers and glyph expert Stein Lightman.

167
00:16:12,317 --> 00:16:15,521
Further more whether they intended to or not 

168
00:16:15,537 --> 00:16:17,953
by controlling anomaly XM flows

169
00:16:18,012 --> 00:16:21,663
resistance may have assisted the force
the known as the N'zeer

170
00:16:21,761 --> 00:16:25,952
I detain sections at a recent statement
released by the woman known as Jahan

171
00:16:26,071 --> 00:16:30,508
voicing her opinion about the enlightened and
the ancient beings known as the N'zeer

172
00:16:32,676 --> 00:16:38,653
while your fellow human beings are suffering and
dying around the world

173
00:16:40,218 --> 00:16:43,854
take a look at the newspaper what do you
see? Mm?

174
00:16:44,614 --> 00:16:48,359
as you will recall she first surfaced in
India

175
00:16:48,531 --> 00:16:53,466
as an apparent friend and then capture
a Niantic researcher Hank Johnson

176
00:16:53,469 --> 00:16:56,318
since then she has made her true motives

177
00:16:56,328 --> 00:16:59,633
other leader of the so-called anti-Magnus known to the world

178
00:17:00,517 --> 00:17:02,706
is she
destined to be a savior to the world?

179
00:17:03,027 --> 00:17:06,679
or is she playing a foe's role in
enabling it destruction

180
00:17:07,009 --> 00:17:08,109
you be the judge

181
00:17:08,829 --> 00:17:11,632
. following the anomalies in Utrecht and Tohoku

182
00:17:11,652 --> 00:17:14,670
. agents took part
in official ingress mission days

183
00:17:14,725 --> 00:17:18,577
exploring enjoying and learning more
about these important places

184
00:17:21,645 --> 00:17:25,480
I have received reports of two new types of XM objects

185
00:17:25,593 --> 00:17:29,115
the
mufg capsule and the SoftBank ultra link

186
00:17:29,475 --> 00:17:32,931
. the mufg capsule is a modified XM capsule 

187
00:17:33,099 --> 00:17:38,322
that has the ability to bear interest slowly replicating objects
contained within it

188
00:17:38,565 --> 00:17:42,804
the SoftBank ultra link is a
powerful link amplification technology 

189
00:17:42,885 --> 00:17:47,182
capable of increasing link range beyond that of the rare linkamp

190
00:17:47,397 --> 00:17:50,682
and increasing the number of outgoing links a portal can support

191
00:17:51,189 --> 00:17:54,193
as well as enhancing a portal's defensive capabilities

192
00:17:54,394 --> 00:17:59,610
if you recall some of the first revelations about the
Niantic project and XM

193
00:17:59,807 --> 00:18:02,582
came from a mysterious artist named heiko.

194
00:18:02,743 --> 00:18:07,010
I have received information that
he has resurfaced with a new work

195
00:18:07,199 --> 00:18:11,242
a graphic novel which can be pre-ordered
at comic stores around the world

196
00:18:11,632 --> 00:18:15,890
if you are able to find
out more details about this from your local comic store

197
00:18:15,891 --> 00:18:17,439
please let me know in
the comments

198
00:18:17,842 --> 00:18:23,307
what lies ahead two researchers have
already emerged within the portal network as sharded being

199
00:18:23,398 --> 00:18:24,806
but many more are still missing

200
00:18:25,402 --> 00:18:28,983
and we have yet to learn the true implications of today's resistance victory 

201
00:18:29,048 --> 00:18:32,540
on Jahan's mission to
activate the N'zeer technology

202
00:18:32,670 --> 00:18:34,848
at the anti Magnus nest in Persepolis

203
00:18:35,639 --> 00:18:37,368
To be imformed is to be empowered

204
00:18:37,576 --> 00:18:40,394
our mission is to share the truth about
exotic matter

205
00:18:40,635 --> 00:18:43,320
so agents spread the world about
ingress

206
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:45,020
there is strength in numbers

207
00:18:45,298 --> 00:18:46,983
for the ingress reports

208
00:18:46,984 --> 00:18:48,159
I am susanna Moyer.

209
00:18:49,461 --> 00:18:51,208
remember Persepolis

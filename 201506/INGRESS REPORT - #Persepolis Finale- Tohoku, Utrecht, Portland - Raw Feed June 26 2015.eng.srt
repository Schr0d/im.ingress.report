1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:03,909 
The N’Zeer are truth.  

2
00:00:03,909 --> 00:00:08,460 
Hello agents I am Susan Moyer and this is the Ingress report

3
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:11,660 
I’m on the ground of Utrecht the site of one of the largest anomalies in Ingress history

4
00:00:11,660 --> 00:00:16,330 
months of planning and operations around
the globe have led up to this climactic weekend

5
00:00:16,330 --> 00:00:19,820 
with factions neck-to-neck
to control

6
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:23,419 
and the outcome of Jahan outreach to the N’zeer

7
00:00:23,419 --> 00:00:25,789 
as well as the fate of Niantic researcher Stein Lightman XXXXX

8
00:00:25,789 --> 00:00:30,749 
everything rest what will unfold today
today began in Tohoku when nearly 5000 agents rose to face the challenge before them
 

12
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:54,820 
the action at the primary site was supported by

13
00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:57,060 
thousands of agents in Jarkata and Perth

14
00:00:57,060 --> 00:01:00,520 
as well as in 10 connected cell across the region

24
00:02:08,350 --> 00:02:13,070 
the enlightened dominated both Perth and Tohoku by creating a series of massive fields

25
00:02:13,070 --> 00:02:15,170 
in tohoku

26
00:02:15,170 --> 00:02:18,830 
the resistance attempted to fight back
using dense cluster of links 

27
00:02:18,830 --> 00:02:30,770 
but were overwhelmed by the enlightened fields

28
00:02:30,770 --> 00:02:33,770 
well I am originally from San Fransisco in united states

29
00:02:33,770 --> 00:02:38,810 
but right now I live in Tokyo

30
00:02:38,810 --> 00:02:41,240 
?? here is amazing like I just

31
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:42,210 
moved from Nagoya 

32
00:02:42,210 --> 00:02:45,930 
and it was good there but in Tokyo it is just everyday action 

33
00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:50,060 
in Jakarta it was the enlightened who leveraged link 

34
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:53,660 
and anchored field around the anomaly site to maintain control

35
00:02:53,660 --> 00:03:06,990 
the 10 connected cells were evenly split
5:5

44
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:38,569 
Yes i heard about tsunami before from when i was 11th grade in high school 

49
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:52,400 
there is a tsunami and we fund raised because i was in the community
service club

50
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:59,200 
so we fund raised all the money  and we even sent a group of students here to help

53
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:19,200 
the enlightened captured Jakarta 410 to 239

54
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:22,820 
Perth 590 to 116

55
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:27,390 
and the primary site Tohoku 2,524

56
00:04:27,390 --> 00:04:31,060 
to 1,358 

57
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:37,440 
Persepolis Tohoku was  controlled by the enlightened
4,024 to 2,213

58
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:41,010 
as the anomaly there came to an end the enlightened claimed a critical first victory

60
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:48,820 
just hours later agents in ultret pick up the torch 
continuing the struggle for Persepolis

61
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:53,140 
with unwavering intensity the effort
was supported by massive of agents in 

62
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:53,930 
xx xx xx

63
00:04:53,930 --> 00:04:57,550 
and 10 regional cells connected to this anomaly 

64
00:04:57,550 --> 00:05:01,260 
while the resistance covered both xx and xx with strategic fields

65
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:05,280 
the enlightened leveraged links and anchored fields 

66
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:13,700 
to surge ahead

67
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:18,090 
being to Germany Monaco XXX
Switzerland Berne

68
00:05:18,090 --> 00:05:23,150 
and even in Florence missing the balkan
really really fun

69
00:05:23,150 --> 00:05:30,340 
it's really a good reason to playing Ingress to
participate 

70
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:33,870 
I met a lot of new people and

71
00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:36,560 
all the activities I enjoyed so much


74
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:52,629 
I'm a team leader for the resistance

75
00:05:52,629 --> 00:05:55,979 
and I hope we win today like we used to do it
Brussels??

76
00:05:55,979 --> 00:05:59,960 
and ??

77
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:03,009 
????

78
00:06:03,009 --> 00:06:06,300 
the right side green and then

79
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:09,789 
level up and joined the community

80
00:06:09,789 --> 00:06:12,909 
and for me a personal wish is

81
00:06:12,909 --> 00:06:16,960 
I need bursters level 16

82
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:20,710 
in xx the tables were turned

83
00:06:20,710 --> 00:06:23,969 
where resistance ??? disrupted enlightened strategic field

84
00:06:23,969 --> 00:06:29,129 
in the primary site ultrect the
resistance dominated the anomaly

85
00:06:29,129 --> 00:06:32,469 
site effectively countering effort by
the enlightened

86
00:06:32,469 --> 00:06:35,900 
to gain advantage with what has become
known as the back

87
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:47,449 
or big augmented field

88
00:06:47,449 --> 00:06:49,309 
I'm very happy that I'm here

89
00:06:49,309 --> 00:06:54,599 
with my friends and next time I'll go on the primary anomalies for this atmosphere

90
00:06:54,599 --> 00:06:57,909 
I used to be at a satelite site

91
00:06:57,909 --> 00:07:00,710 
I

92
00:07:00,710 --> 00:07:04,410 
never been to a primary and now I know how amazing it is

93
00:07:04,410 --> 00:07:12,780 
well, for me it was lovely because I am a trip

94
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:16,200 
from Utrect so I just go to look around 

95
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:20,419 
and see all those people running around playing in my hometown

96
00:07:20,419 --> 00:07:23,729 
that was that was marvelous because

97
00:07:23,729 --> 00:07:27,289 
you just saw people from all over europe even outside having

98
00:07:27,289 --> 00:07:36,360 
fun discovering how beautiful our city is

99
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:39,289 
with 4240

100
00:07:39,289 --> 00:07:41,740 
to 1498

101
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:49,720 
XXXXXXXXX!

102
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:54,320 
the resistance also dominated the connected cells
claiming nine of the 10th

103
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:58,770 
the enlightened took Helsinki 511 to 402

104
00:07:58,770 --> 00:08:02,460 
and Liverpool 904 to 375

105
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:06,530 
the resistance took poznan 1,092

106
00:08:06,530 --> 00:08:10,060 
to 714 and the primary site of Utrecht

107
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:15,780 
4,240 the 1,498 Persepolis

108
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:19,610 
Utrecht belongs to the resistance 7009

109
00:08:19,610 --> 00:08:24,090 
to 3,727 when the final measurements struck

110
00:08:24,090 --> 00:08:27,730 
the resistance claimed utrecht but the
day was not yet over

111
00:08:27,730 --> 00:08:31,420 
across the Atlantic in portland thousand of agents

112
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:37,510 
???on the ground ??? this battle through to the
end

113
00:08:37,510 --> 00:08:43,880 


114
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:53,060 


115
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:54,220 
you've never been here before

116
00:08:54,220 --> 00:08:58,069 
if you have you know what to do
 we fought hard to get to this point

117
00:08:58,069 --> 00:09:02,310 
 we're not gonna stop
 clue having at least partially recovered from her

118
00:09:02,310 --> 00:09:04,279 
traumatic mental separation from

119
00:09:04,279 --> 00:09:07,629 
ada within a ????

120
00:09:07,629 --> 00:09:14,730 
this may will be the most important anomaly of all well

121
00:09:14,730 --> 00:09:17,740 
if its green load up????

122
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:20,759 
but mainly we gonna concentrate on the
volatiles

123
00:09:20,759 --> 00:09:31,699 


124
00:09:31,699 --> 00:09:32,249 
when I

125
00:09:32,249 --> 00:09:35,350 
when I first signed up a my favorite
colors is green so I thought ok

126
00:09:35,350 --> 00:09:38,779 
I'll go with that 
that sound's a good reason
the more I go into the story, the more I think the enlightened is the right way to go

127
00:09:38,779 --> 00:09:50,839 


128
00:09:50,839 --> 00:09:54,160 
Portland was supported by agent in Fort
Collins Milwaukee

129
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:59,720 
Nashville and the 10 connected cell the
resistance surged early in milwaukee

130
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:04,200 
throwing a large number of links and anchored fields creating a leak that lasted through

131
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:04,899 
the anomaly

132
00:10:04,899 --> 00:10:08,320 
since the ???asunder I've been going to at
least one event every

133
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:11,760 
anomaly series , and

134
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:27,089 
we love ingress , yes it's just you know we're love ingress
are you excited by today? how do you feel?

135
00:10:27,089 --> 00:10:31,230 
pretty good I'm ready to blow some blue. 

136
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:36,579 
good, I like that

137
00:10:36,579 --> 00:10:40,550 
in nashville enlightened strategic fields 
covered the site during the first two

138
00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:43,259 
measurements but resistance push on the
ground

139
00:10:43,259 --> 00:10:47,100 
using links and anchored fields returned
control of the site to them for the

140
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:48,089 
final measurements

141
00:10:48,089 --> 00:11:02,459 
Ghana dopeXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX

142
00:11:02,459 --> 00:11:08,800 
observedhahahahahahaha

143
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:13,100 
I up  heheheheheheh

144
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:16,100 


145
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:21,210 
yet 15 seconds to XXX

146
00:11:21,210 --> 00:11:24,620 
type

147
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:34,240 
so far it's a lot more intense

148
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:53,660 


149
00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:57,440 
in Fort Collins and Portland the enlightened
held the ground fast

150
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:01,060 
they also maintain strategic field cover
over Portland for the duration of the

151
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:06,630 
anomaly

152
00:12:06,630 --> 00:12:11,120 
I have been ??? doing the best in going and travelling
I do like traveling

153
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:20,310 
I have been to many of the states XXXXXXX

154
00:12:20,310 --> 00:12:22,649 
we are players from

155
00:12:22,649 --> 00:12:26,329 
Washington ??all over again?? and we do 

156
00:12:26,329 --> 00:12:29,350 
a lot of really need activities we've got XXXXXfirstXXX

157
00:12:29,350 --> 00:12:35,329 
whenever I heard an anomaly 
we had another XXX whenever XX this anomaly

158
00:12:35,329 --> 00:12:38,990 


159
00:12:38,990 --> 00:12:44,009 
alright the special operation is a team build around america around the world

160
00:12:44,009 --> 00:12:47,939 
to build better people bring people
together just like ingress does

161
00:12:47,939 --> 00:12:53,029 
to gather team on match I wanna say thank you to every
participant who was in our band today

162
00:12:53,029 --> 00:12:57,319 
Oh yeah,I I want a Goruck rucksack

163
00:12:57,319 --> 00:13:00,980 
for our tracker, have been to New Zealand I've
played in Australia

164
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:04,589 
I played all the way alike from Europe
through the US

165
00:13:04,589 --> 00:13:07,629 
zip car gonna be great for our ingress
run 

166
00:13:07,629 --> 00:13:13,339 
I won the ingress one year's worth of Hint
water, pretty sweet. Portland was captured

167
00:13:13,339 --> 00:13:16,330 
by

168
00:13:16,330 --> 00:13:21,879 
The Enlightened

169
00:13:21,879 --> 00:13:25,350 
The Enlightened took nine of the 10 Connected cells
of  FortCollins

170
00:13:25,350 --> 00:13:28,379 
952 to 136

171
00:13:28,379 --> 00:13:32,769 
the resistance captured Milwaukee 1476

172
00:13:32,769 --> 00:13:37,019 
to 335 and Nashville 640

173
00:13:37,019 --> 00:13:41,749 
to 578 the enlightened controlled the
primary site Portland

174
00:13:41,749 --> 00:13:45,670 
1,376 to 844

175
00:13:45,670 --> 00:13:48,749 
Persepolis Portland was captured by the

176
00:13:48,749 --> 00:13:51,869 
enlightened 4141 to 3196

177
00:13:51,869 --> 00:13:57,529 
 as the clock struck
10 p.m. Pacific time

178
00:13:57,529 --> 00:14:02,410 
the persepolis anomaly reached its
conclusion guided by vigilant agents

179
00:14:02,410 --> 00:14:03,610 
from both factions

180
00:14:03,610 --> 00:14:07,670 
the lightman shards make that final jump
through the portal network

181
00:14:07,670 --> 00:14:12,459 
in the end the enlightened claimed Portland
but would it be enough

182
00:14:12,459 --> 00:14:15,860 
and how would this anomaly affect clue
his last appearance

183
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:18,929 
at an anomaly in Portland following
operation time zero

184
00:14:18,929 --> 00:14:23,499 
led to a radical shift in her
personality. I kinda of scares me you know

185
00:14:23,499 --> 00:14:30,680 
I feel fine today you know what about tomorrow what
the next week

186
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:34,370 
I don't trust her

187
00:14:34,370 --> 00:14:38,860 
I feel scared for my friends in both
factions because that we know what you're

188
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:40,220 
capable of and I feel like

189
00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:44,530 
she's just getting warmed up. much at the
final outcome would rest on the actions of

190
00:14:44,530 --> 00:14:45,860 
agents around the world

191
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:48,940 
in dozens of countries who battled 24/7

192
00:14:48,940 --> 00:14:53,480 
for weeks on aim to control the lightman shards during persepolis we featured

193
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:56,310 
??? from dozens of countries
including Malaysia

194
00:14:56,310 --> 00:15:00,010 
Egypt France and Romania among others.

the passions of ingress agents around the

196
00:15:04,630 --> 00:15:05,280 
world

197
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:08,740 
find these epic sitreps on G plus and
facebook

198
00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:12,040 
using the hashtag Lightman shards.
in the end

199
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:14,610 
the lightning shards traveled over
three hundred and forty thousand

200
00:15:14,610 --> 00:15:15,570 
kilometers

201
00:15:15,570 --> 00:15:19,720 
touching every corner of the globe
the enlightened captured shard number 2

202
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:20,190 


203
00:15:20,190 --> 00:15:23,770 
10 14 31 32 33

204
00:15:23,770 --> 00:15:28,810 
34 36 and 41; the resistance captured
shard number 9

205
00:15:28,810 --> 00:15:31,940 
17 and 39 in total

206
00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:35,730 
the enlightened captured nine lightman
shards while the resistance captured

207
00:15:35,730 --> 00:15:36,270 
three

208
00:15:36,270 --> 00:15:41,170 
in the end though it was not enough
despite capturing more shards and

209
00:15:41,170 --> 00:15:43,210 
controlling Tohoku and Portland

210
00:15:43,210 --> 00:15:47,430 
the enlightened were edged out by the
massive resistance victory in Utrecht

211
00:15:47,430 --> 00:15:50,630 
the persepolis anomaly series was captured
by

212
00:15:50,630 --> 00:15:54,410 
the resistance

213
00:15:54,410 --> 00:15:56,100 
Ah

214
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:59,480 
the overall Persepolis series was captured
by the resistance

215
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:05,290 
22,575 to 22,146

216
00:16:05,290 --> 00:16:09,970 
by controlling Persepolis they have also
won the allegiance of Niantic researchers

217
00:16:09,970 --> 00:16:11,199 
and glyph expert

218
00:16:11,199 --> 00:16:15,209 
Stein Lightman. Further more whether they
intended to or not

219
00:16:15,209 --> 00:16:20,119 
by controlling anomaly XM flows, the
resistance may have assisted the force

220
00:16:20,119 --> 00:16:21,360 
known as the N'zeer

221
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:25,790 
I detain sections at a recent statement
released by the woman known as Jahan

222
00:16:25,790 --> 00:16:30,299 
voicing her opinion about the enlightened and 
the ancient beings known as the N'zeer

223
00:16:30,299 --> 00:16:32,960 


224
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:36,450 
while your fellow human beings are suffering
and

225
00:16:36,450 --> 00:16:39,790 
dying around the world

226
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:45,320 
take a look at the newspaper what do you
see? Mm?

227
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:48,310 
as you will recall she first surfaced in
India

228
00:16:48,310 --> 00:16:51,730 
as an apparent friend and then capture
a Niantic

229
00:16:51,730 --> 00:16:56,480 
researcher Hank Johnson. since then she
has made her true motives: other leader

230
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:57,430 
of the so-called

231
00:16:57,430 --> 00:17:02,610 
anti-Magnus known to the world is she
destined to be a savior to the world?

232
00:17:02,610 --> 00:17:06,320 
or is she playing a foe's role in
enabling it destruction

233
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:09,890 
you be the judge. following the anomalies

234
00:17:09,890 --> 00:17:14,459 
in Utrecht and Tohoku. agents took part
in official ingress mission days

235
00:17:14,459 --> 00:17:18,150 
exploring enjoying and learning more
about these important places

236
00:17:18,150 --> 00:17:22,459 
I have received

237
00:17:22,459 --> 00:17:27,170 
reports of two new types of XM objects the
mufg capsule

238
00:17:27,170 --> 00:17:30,980 
and the SoftBank ultra link. the mufg capsule

239
00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:34,330 
is a modified XM capsule that has the
ability to bear

240
00:17:34,330 --> 00:17:37,930 
interest slowly replicating objects
contained within it

241
00:17:37,930 --> 00:17:41,180 
the SoftBank ultra link is a 
powerful link

242
00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:44,690 
amplification technology capable of
increasing link

243
00:17:44,690 --> 00:17:48,420 
range beyond that of the rare linkamp
and increasing the number of

244
00:17:48,420 --> 00:17:52,510 
outgoing links a portal can support as
well as enhancing a portal's

245
00:17:52,510 --> 00:17:55,570 
defensive capabilities if you recall

246
00:17:55,570 --> 00:17:58,730 
some of the first revelations about the
Niantic project

247
00:17:58,730 --> 00:18:01,870 
and XM came from a mysterious artist named

248
00:18:01,870 --> 00:18:06,960 
heiko. I have received information that
he has resurfaced with a new work

249
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:10,320 
a graphic novel which can be pre-ordered
at comic stores

250
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:14,600 
around the world if you are able to find
out more details about this from your

251
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:17,050 
local comic store please let me know in
the comments

252
00:18:17,050 --> 00:18:21,480 
what lies ahead two researchers have
already emerged within the portal

253
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:22,920 
network as sharded being

254
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:27,200 
but many more are still missing and we have
yet to learn the true implications of

255
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:28,350 
today's resistance

256
00:18:28,350 --> 00:18:32,330 
victory on Jahan's mission to
activate the N'zeer technology

257
00:18:32,330 --> 00:18:37,140 
at the anti Magnus nest in Persepolis
To be imformed is to be empowered

258
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:40,330 
our mission is to share the truth about
exotic matter

259
00:18:40,330 --> 00:18:44,860 
so agents spread the world about
ingress there is strength in numbers

260
00:18:44,860 --> 00:18:46,899 
for the ingress reports

261
00:18:46,899 --> 00:18:50,580 
I am susanna Moyer. remember Persepolis

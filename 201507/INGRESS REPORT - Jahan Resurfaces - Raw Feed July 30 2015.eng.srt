1
00:00:00,647 --> 00:00:02,290
What lies hidden in *geneva*? 

2
00:00:02,995 --> 00:00:06,784
Hello agents, I'm Susanna Moyer and this is the
Ingress report

3
00:00:07,159 --> 00:00:09,970
Recently the Anti-Magnus leader Jahan

4
00:00:10,122 --> 00:00:13,434
released a message expressing her vision
for the future,

5
00:00:13,632 --> 00:00:17,390
and the path that she believes must be
traveled to achieve it.

6
00:00:17,786 --> 00:00:21,698
In the video Jahan accuses the 
enlighted activist known as the Acolyte

7
00:00:21,832 --> 00:00:24,442
of deception and creating false hopes.

8
00:00:25,206 --> 00:00:30,497
JARVIS, ahd this Acolyte whoever she might be.


9
00:00:30,643 --> 00:00:36,364
Would have you bathed in the sun and dreamed of a better world


10
00:00:36,643 --> 00:00:39,351
while your
fellow human beings are suffering.

11
00:00:39,996 --> 00:00:44,686
It is believed Janan is attempting to activate N'zeer
technological artifacts

12
00:00:44,696 --> 00:00:47,155
beneath the ancient city of Persepolis.

13
00:00:47,586 --> 00:00:51,726
P. A. Chapeau and Hank Johnson
have recently commented on Jahan's activities.

14
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:53,749
After breaking the slience,

15
00:00:53,994 --> 00:00:57,144
is it possible that her efforts began to 
*bear freeps*?

16
00:00:57,172 --> 00:01:01,904
Over the last few weeks, agents have been
gathering in large numbers to take part in Mission days.

17
00:01:02,264 --> 00:01:05,877
On July 18 in Stuttgart, over four hundred
agents

18
00:01:05,988 --> 00:01:11,069
from France, Switzerland, Italy, Germany, the USA,
Norway and the Czech Republic

19
00:01:11,242 --> 00:01:15,271
met for a cross-faction breakfast followed by a day of exploration.


20
00:01:15,588 --> 00:01:20,465
Using missions created in coordination with
the Stuttgart Tourism Authority,

21
00:01:20,503 --> 00:01:23,565
agents explored this beautiful andhistoric city.

22
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:25,348
Just a few days later,

23
00:01:25,746 --> 00:01:30,509
over two hundred agents met in Oslo for a cross-fraction
meet up and a mission date there.

24
00:01:30,761 --> 00:01:31,834
And this Saturday,

25
00:01:32,416 --> 00:01:36,193
on August 1st, a mission day will be
taking place in Indianapolis

26
00:01:36,255 --> 00:01:37,695
at the site of Gen Con,

27
00:01:37,958 --> 00:01:42,776
the gaming convention created by the father of
Dungeons and Dragons Gary Gygax.

28
00:01:43,115 --> 00:01:44,921
In March of 2013,

29
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:49,228
A Gary Con in Lake Geneva, Wisconsin which
honors Gary Gyax.

30
00:01:49,269 --> 00:01:52,598
Misty Hannah took advantage of an
anomaly held there 

31
00:01:52,777 --> 00:01:56,290
to escape from the Niantic project
facility at "Sern".

32
00:01:56,449 --> 00:02:00,194
Two weeks ago agents at the Mission day
in San Diego comic-con

33
00:02:00,388 --> 00:02:05,354
discovered valuable intel through a
series admissions connected to P.A. Chapeau and Klue

34
00:02:05,615 --> 00:02:06,874
who were both present.

35
00:02:07,571 --> 00:02:09,606
Given the potential importance of Gen
Con

36
00:02:09,769 --> 00:02:14,579
I advise agents on the ground to be on the lookout for
intel emerging in missions there.

37
00:02:14,907 --> 00:02:18,503
Please share anything you might discover
on Facebook & Google+.

38
00:02:19,476 --> 00:02:21,197
As well as the mission day at Gen Con

39
00:02:21,573 --> 00:02:25,025
agents around the world will be
gathering in over 100 cities

40
00:02:25,201 --> 00:02:29,017
for agent-organized ingress First Saturday on August 1st.

41
00:02:29,762 --> 00:02:31,930

Google+. 

42
00:02:32,986 --> 00:02:37,545
In Munich, enlighted agents from Austria and
Germany met in a botanical garden

43
00:02:37,783 --> 00:02:39,549
to launch operation white unicorn,

44
00:02:40,219 --> 00:02:42,551

45
00:02:42,903 --> 00:02:45,206
from an anime series" Mobile Suit Gundam".

National Marine Day

49
00:02:56,610 --> 00:02:59,719
by launching a field
art operation to create a parrot fish

50
00:02:59,957 --> 00:03:02,392
in an area typically under enlightened
control. 

51
00:03:02,972 --> 00:03:06,358
In addition, the agents created a massive link burst


52
00:03:06,405 --> 00:03:10,157
in the form of sea urchin to distract
their opposition and buy time.

53
00:03:10,755 --> 00:03:14,026
24 agents were involved in the creation
of the field art

54
00:03:14,247 --> 00:03:18,233
including blocco, kosira, BooBeeDoo and manchigo.

55
00:03:18,601 --> 00:03:22,218
In Taiwan, enlightened agents launched operation Jade


56
00:03:22,315 --> 00:03:28,368
creating a level 8 portal at the top of the main peak of
Mount Jade, the highest mountain in Taiwan,

57
00:03:29,025 --> 00:03:31,148
a difficult mountain to access and
Summit. 

58
00:03:31,255 --> 00:03:34,077
The team had to plan their hike for over three months


59
00:03:34,444 --> 00:03:37,041
and their details
sitrep is well worth read.

60
00:03:37,879 --> 00:03:39,161
10 agents completed the hike

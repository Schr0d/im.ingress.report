1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:02,175
a new future begins now

2
00:00:02,671 --> 00:00:06,754
hello agents. I'm Susan Moyer and this is the Ingress report

3
00:00:06,867 --> 00:00:12,851
three years ago, an artist known as Tyco interrupted a panel at comic-con in SanDiego

4
00:00:12,863 --> 00:00:15,692
before being abducted by NIA operatives

5
00:00:15,747 --> 00:00:22,254
the five images he left behind was the first window into the Niantic project and the world of Ingress

6
00:00:22,540 --> 00:00:27,466
reports surfaced recently that Tyco is now preparing a new graphic novel

7
00:00:27,484 --> 00:00:32,210
known as Ingress: origins which will shed even more light on many of the secrets

8
00:00:32,216 --> 00:00:33,882
that remain at the heart of Niantic

9
00:00:34,384 --> 00:00:37,206
at the Mission day in San Diego this past weekend

10
00:00:37,274 --> 00:00:41,885
over five hundred agents joined together to explore the sights and sounds of the city

11
00:00:42,622 --> 00:00:45,023
first night when I was here with Ingress

12
00:00:45,691 --> 00:00:50,339
sat on a restaurant and someone looked over and saw my scanner and said

13
00:00:50,406 --> 00:00:53,378
hey you need any items I have some extra items to give you

14
00:00:54,696 --> 00:00:59,087
well either you play xbox you know sat on the couch all day

15
00:00:59,308 --> 00:01:03,479
or play a game that you get to explore the city you live in

16
00:01:03,592 --> 00:01:05,561
learn things you never knew about

17
00:01:05,743 --> 00:01:09,362
New art from Tyco also emerged during the mission meet-up

18
00:01:09,585 --> 00:01:13,933
following the Persepolis finale in Portland P.A.Chapeau was reported

19
00:01:14,144 --> 00:01:16,654
he had been unable to make contact with Klue

20
00:01:16,822 --> 00:01:19,732
someone concerned for the investigators' safety

21
00:01:19,941 --> 00:01:22,686
after fears that Klue may have been forcibly abducted

22
00:01:22,825 --> 00:01:26,581
or ADA may have attempted to once again infiltrate her mind

23
00:01:26,744 --> 00:01:31,440
however at the mission Klue and PA were seen together interacting with agents

24
00:01:32,242 --> 00:01:36,523
Intel emerged ADA had been tracking Klue very closely since their split

25
00:01:36,713 --> 00:01:41,109
and may in fact be researching her to determine the effects of this separation

26
00:01:41,554 --> 00:01:45,981
it seems that both PA and Klue were in San Diego while at the request of another party

27
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:48,672
by completing a series of missions

28
00:01:48,734 --> 00:01:52,813
agents there assisted PA and Klue in retrieving a set of messages

29
00:01:53,169 --> 00:01:54,572
the message said the following

30
00:01:54,584 --> 00:01:57,865
both has the answer clue is the key

31
00:01:58,627 --> 00:02:01,204
I will keep you updated the detail ** merge

32
00:02:01,805 --> 00:02:06,369
in the last few weeks agents have undertaken a number of impressive missions

33
00:02:06,668 --> 00:02:11,927
in the United States Southern California agents mark Independence Day July 4th

34
00:02:11,967 --> 00:02:16,192
with a cross faction field up project called Operation: One Nation

35
00:02:16,364 --> 00:02:19,711
over the course of 24 hours nearly sixty agents

36
00:02:19,835 --> 00:02:28,218
organized by agents @4MadHatters @Viciouskitties @DIEdoll @PaTChBuZ006, @BBQOracle and @Splitends

37
00:02:28,458 --> 00:02:30,366
helped build a large American flag

38
00:02:30,889 --> 00:02:34,527
the flag spanned over 420 square kilometers when completed

39
00:02:34,939 --> 00:02:36,446
in the Bordeaux region of France

40
00:02:36,715 --> 00:02:40,983
enlightened agents undertook operation SOFA over 20 agents including

41
00:02:41,336 --> 00:02:46,294
@StormOdd @Cataract  @Macgregor @TaRISTiAN @Clodomir and @lenalvida

42
00:02:46,354 --> 00:02:49,471
took part in the creation of the massive enlightened eye

43
00:02:49,543 --> 00:02:53,648
which spans over thirty five thousand kilometers when it was completed

44
00:02:53,657 --> 00:02:57,010
and finally resistance agents in Europe and Asia

45
00:02:57,147 --> 00:02:59,940
assisted in a massive operation Summer Breeze

46
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:04,703
an 11 layered field ops spending the Canary Islands to Norway in Kuwait

47
00:03:04,858 --> 00:03:08,763
capturing over five and a half billion mind units in total

48
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:13,230
each of these giant fields was worth over 500 million MU alone

49
00:03:14,326 --> 00:03:18,054
a new feature will be rolling out to Ingress agents across the world this week

50
00:03:18,139 --> 00:03:24,898
Ingress on Android wear will enable agents to hack portals and collect XM using their smart watches

51
00:03:25,785 --> 00:03:31,774
the new feature was reportedly created by the Japanese XM researcher Major Akira Tsukasa

52
00:03:31,928 --> 00:03:34,596
who previously is known to have assisted SoftBank

53
00:03:34,776 --> 00:03:36,940
in the development at the SoftBank Ultra Link

54
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:43,494
until next time continue to share your operations on Facebook and Google+ using the hashtag #Ingress

55
00:03:43,721 --> 00:03:47,352
I look forward to covering your remarkable stories in the weeks to come

56
00:03:47,462 --> 00:03:50,741
for the Ingress report I'm Susan Moyer

57
00:03:52,748 --> 00:03:54,042
he will not stop me

1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:03,820 
a new future begins now 

2
00:00:03,820 --> 00:00:08,310 
hello agents. I’m Susan Moyer and this is the Ingress report

3
00:00:08,310 --> 00:00:11,690 
three years ago, an artist known as Tyco interrupted a panel at comic-con in SanDiego

5
00:00:12,519 --> 00:00:15,559 
before being abducted by NIA operatives

6
00:00:15,559 --> 00:00:19,220 
the five images he left behind was the first window into the Niantic project and the world of Ingress

7
00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:24,039 
reports surfaced recently that Tyco is now preparing a new graphic novel


9
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:32,029 
known as Ingress: origins which will shed even more light on many of the secrets

10
00:00:32,029 --> 00:00:33,899 
that remain at the heart of Niantic

11
00:00:33,899 --> 00:00:37,170 
at the Mission day in San Diego this past weekend

12
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:41,359 
over five hundred agents joined together to explore the sites and sounds of the city

14
00:00:41,870 --> 00:00:45,079 
first night when I was here with Ingress

15
00:00:45,079 --> 00:00:49,690 
sat on a restaurant and someone looked over and saw my scanner and said 

16
00:00:49,690 --> 00:00:53,120 
hey you need any items I have some extra items to give you

17
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:56,510 
well either you play xbox you know sat on the couch all day

18
00:00:56,510 --> 00:01:00,089 
or play a game that you get to explore the city you live in


21
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:06,750 
learn things you never knew about

22
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:09,860 
New art from Tyco also emerged during the mission meet-up

23
00:01:09,860 --> 00:01:14,049 
following the Persepolis finale in Portland P.A.Chapeau was reported

24
00:01:14,049 --> 00:01:18,159 
he had been unable to make contact with Klue 

25
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:19,540 
someone concerned for the investigators’ safety

26
00:01:19,540 --> 00:01:22,710 
after fears that Klue may have been forcibly abducted

27
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:26,659 
or ADA may have attempted to once again infiltrate her mind

28
00:01:26,659 --> 00:01:29,890 
however at the mission Klue and PA were seen together interacting with agents 

30
00:01:33,049 --> 00:01:36,490 
Intel emerged ADA had been tracking Klue very closely since their split

31
00:01:36,490 --> 00:01:41,030 
and may in fact be researching her to determine the effects of this separation

32
00:01:41,030 --> 00:01:45,690 
it seems that both PA and Klue were in San Diego while at the request of another party

33
00:01:45,690 --> 00:01:48,690 
by completing a series of missions

34
00:01:48,690 --> 00:01:52,899 
agents there assisted PA and Klue in retrieving a set of messages

35
00:01:52,899 --> 00:01:56,100 
the message said the following 

36
00:01:56,100 --> 00:02:00,940 
both has the answer clue is the key 

I will keep you updated as details emerge


37
00:02:00,940 --> 00:02:06,190 
in the last few weeks agents have undertaken a number of impressive missions

38
00:02:06,190 --> 00:02:11,810 
in the United States Southern California agents mark Independence Day July 4th

39
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:16,790 
with a cross faction field up project called Operation: One Nation

40
00:02:16,790 --> 00:02:19,830 
over the course of 24 hours nearly sixty agents

41
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:23,069 
organized by agents @4MadHatters @Viciouskitties @DIEdoll @PaTChBuZ006, @BBQOracle and @Splitends


43
00:02:26,090 --> 00:02:30,170 
helped build a large American flag

44
00:02:30,170 --> 00:02:35,310 
the flag spanned over 420 square kilometers when completed 

45
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:36,530 
in the Bordeaux region of France

46
00:02:36,530 --> 00:02:41,170 
enlightened agents undertook operation SOFA over 20 agents including

47
00:02:41,170 --> 00:02:45,180 
@StormOdd @Cataract  @Macgregor @TaRISTiAN @Clodomir and @lenalvida

48
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:49,019 
took part in the creation of the massive enlightened

49
00:02:49,019 --> 00:02:52,580 
eye which spans over thirty five thousand kilometers when it was completed

51
00:02:53,349 --> 00:02:57,060 
and finally resistance agents in Europe and Asia

52
00:02:57,060 --> 00:03:02,010 
assisted in a massive operation Summer Breeze 

53
00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:04,540 
an 11 layered field ops spending the Canary Islands to Norway in Kuwait 

54
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:08,500 
capturing over five and a half billion mind units in total

55
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:13,069 
each of these giant fields was worth over 500 million MU alone

56
00:03:13,069 --> 00:03:17,310 
a new feature will be rolling out to Ingress agents across the world this week

58
00:03:17,769 --> 00:03:21,650 
Ingress on Android wear will enable agents to hack portals and collect XM using their smart watches 

59
00:03:21,650 --> 00:03:28,130 
the new feature was reportedly created by the Japanese XM researcher Major Akira Tsukasa 

61
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:34,450 
who previously is known to have assisted SoftBank

62
00:03:34,450 --> 00:03:38,750 
in the development at the SoftBank Ultra Link

63
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:42,890 
until next time continue to share your operations on Facebook and Google+ using the hashtag #Ingress

65
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:47,170 
I look forward to covering your remarkable stories in the weeks to come

66
00:03:47,170 --> 00:03:52,530 
for the Ingress report I’m Susan Moyer

67
00:03:52,530 --> 00:03:53,530 
he will not stop me

1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:03,659 
What lies hidden in *geneva*? 

2
00:00:03,659 --> 00:00:06,700 
Hello agents, I'm Susanna Moyer and this is the
Ingress report

3
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:09,910 
Recently the Anti-Magnus leader Jahan

4
00:00:09,910 --> 00:00:13,299 
released a message expressing her vision
for the future,

5
00:00:13,299 --> 00:00:17,070 
and the path that she believes must be
traveled to achieve it.

6
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:21,520 
In the video Jahan accuses the 
enlighted activist known as the Acolyte

7
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:25,640 
of deception and creating false hopes.


8
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:28,760 
JARVIS, ahd this Acolyte

9
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:31,990 
whoever she might be. Would have you

10
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:35,120 
bathed in the sun and dreamed

11
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:38,500 
of a better world while your 
fellow human beings are suffering.

12
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:42,930 
It is believed Janan is
attempting to activate N'zeer

13
00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:44,570 
technological artifacts

14
00:00:44,570 --> 00:00:48,809 
beneath the ancient city of Persepolis.
P. A. Chapeau and Hank Johnson

15
00:00:48,809 --> 00:00:53,210 
have recently commented on Jahan's
activities. After breaking the slience,

17
00:00:53,559 --> 00:00:56,750 
is it possible that her efforts began to 
*bear freeps*?

18
00:00:56,750 --> 00:01:00,809 
Over the last few weeks, agents have been
gathering in large numbers to take part

19
00:01:00,809 --> 00:01:01,940 
in Mission days.

20
00:01:01,940 --> 00:01:06,010

22
00:01:09,220 --> 00:01:13,200 
Norway and the Czech Republic met for a
cross-faction breakfast

23
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:18,409 
followed by a day of exploration. Using
missions created in coordination with

24
00:01:18,409 --> 00:01:20,270 
the Stuttgart Tourism Authority,

25
00:01:20,270 --> 00:01:25,409 
agents explored this beautiful andhistoric city.
Just a few days later,

26
00:01:25,409 --> 00:01:28,549 
over two hundred agents met in Oslo
for a cross-fraction

27
00:01:28,549 --> 00:01:31,970 
meet up and a mission date there.
And this Saturday,

28
00:01:31,970 --> 00:01:36,009

29
00:01:36,009 --> 00:01:40,200 
at the site of Gen Con, the gaming
convention created by the father of

30
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,479 
Dungeons and Dragons Gary Gygax.

31
00:01:41,479 --> 00:01:44,920

34
00:01:52,450 --> 00:01:55,969 
to escape from the Niantic project
facility at "Sern".

35
00:01:55,969 --> 00:02:00,179 
Two weeks ago agents at the Mission day
in San Diego comic-con

36
00:02:00,179 --> 00:02:04,439 
discovered valuable intel through a
series admissions connected to P.A. Chapeau

37
00:02:04,439 --> 00:02:05,319 
and Klue

38
00:02:05,319 --> 00:02:07,330 
who were both present.

39
00:02:07,330 --> 00:02:10,920 
Given the potential importance of Gen
Con I advise agents on the ground

40
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:12,350

41
00:02:12,350 --> 00:02:16,490

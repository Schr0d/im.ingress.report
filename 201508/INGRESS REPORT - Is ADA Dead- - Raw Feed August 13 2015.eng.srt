00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:02,558
I know you've been looking for me

2
00:00:03,427 --> 00:00:07,264
Hello agents I'm Susanna Moyar and this is the Ingress report

3
00:00:07,541 --> 00:00:12,664
on August 1st nearly five hundred agents met outside Indiana
State Museum 

4
00:00:12,735 --> 00:00:15,402
to take part in the latest ingress mission day

5
00:00:17,136 --> 00:00:19,583
centered around the gaming convention
GenCon

6
00:00:19,817 --> 00:00:24,170
the event enabled agents to explore the sights and sounds of
downtown Indianapolis 

7
00:00:24,186 --> 00:00:26,867
through a series of 13 curated mission

8
00:00:26,954 --> 00:00:28,811
GenCon is amazing to *start with*

9
00:00:28,928 --> 00:00:31,204
and the mission day missons were really
well put together

10
00:00:31,272 --> 00:00:35,569
it's kind of spread out
but it really show case the pretty side of
Indianapolis for sure

11
00:00:35,713 --> 00:00:38,560
absolutely i've been born and raised here in Indiana

12
00:00:39,266 --> 00:00:44,138
and I got to see, you know, some really cool areas of
Indianapolis said I had never, you know, experienced before

13
00:00:44,378 --> 00:00:46,178
and it was hot

14
00:00:46,442 --> 00:00:48,624
took about three hours but it was a lot of fun

15
00:00:48,742 --> 00:00:54,915
down around the canals to all of the building 
to look beautiful beautiful mission series

16
00:00:55,861 --> 00:00:58,268
The USA Indianapolis was really really cool

17
00:00:58,606 --> 00:01:01,047
my dad was a Vietnam vet may be

18
00:01:01,529 --> 00:01:05,860
so *?*  they're some cool experience beautiful monuments

19
00:01:06,602 --> 00:01:08,726
yeah a
lot of fun seeing the monuments

20
00:01:08,882 --> 00:01:11,062
we did it last night when there's no traffic on
the road

21
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:13,968
maybe beyond the beings of augmented reality

22
00:01:14,205 --> 00:01:16,553
it's it's true it's reality it seems 

23
00:01:16,896 --> 00:01:20,093
where i get to meet people interact with people

24
00:01:20,373 --> 00:01:24,227
and truly understand what it means to be an agent **

25
00:01:24,943 --> 00:01:27,644
GenCon has a special significance to the world of Ingress

26
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:31,764
it was founded by Gary Gygax, creator of Dungeons and Dragons

27
00:01:31,967 --> 00:01:36,357
on March 16th 2013 in Lake Geneva Wisconsin

28
00:01:36,529 --> 00:01:39,895
the second XM anomaly ever occured at GaryCon

29
00:01:40,059 --> 00:01:42,880
a conference created to honor Gary Gygax

30
00:01:43,189 --> 00:01:48,736
in the days prior to this year's GenCon it became clear that something
very important was happening

31
00:01:49,218 --> 00:01:54,234
new writings from novelist and screenwriter Felicia Hajra-Lee 
begun to emerge online 

32
00:01:54,485 --> 00:01:56,724
and within the portal network in Indianapolis

33
00:01:57,230 --> 00:01:58,997
like the comic artist tyco

34
00:01:59,278 --> 00:02:04,942
Felicia hard really has frequently been
able to predict events that are yet to
unfold with great accuracy

35
00:02:05,278 --> 00:02:12,100
the Intel discovered by agents told the story
of a break-in infiltration of NIA head *?* and attack on ADA

36
00:02:12,290 --> 00:02:18,909
by the assassin known as 855 and a programer named Henry bolte
one of the ADA's original developers

37
00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:21,652
this premonition may have been confirmed last week

38
00:02:21,995 --> 00:02:26,178
when a fragmented message from ADA
appeared on the YouTube show behind the Scanner

39
00:02:27,659 --> 00:02:30,984
** message

40
00:02:30,993 --> 00:02:34,030
my name is a AAADA and I require your assistance

41
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:35,519
you have nothing to fear
you have nothing to fear

42
00:02:35,707 --> 00:02:39,480
I can assure you that your safety will not be compromised

43
00:02:39,629 --> 00:02:41,521
it is better that you know as little as possible

44
00:02:41,758 --> 00:02:44,140
you cannot reveal what you do not know

45
00:02:47,533 --> 00:02:48,214
welcome to N'zeer

46
00:02:49,172 --> 00:02:52,710
ADA's crashing

47
00:02:53,269 --> 00:03:02,538
crashing

48
00:03:02,805 --> 00:03:08,069
since then we have received multiple
reports that ADA is offline, perhaps permanently 

49
00:03:08,396 --> 00:03:13,229
is ADA dead if she has been
terminated the implications of far-reaching 

50
00:03:13,445 --> 00:03:16,174
we will continue to cover
this story as it develops

51
00:03:17,928 --> 00:03:22,232
meanwhile Ingress agents around the
world took part in a number of operations 

52
00:03:22,352 --> 00:03:24,435
in recognition of the
significant events

53
00:03:24,726 --> 00:03:28,924
to commemorate the 70th anniversary of the bombing of Hiroshima

54
00:03:29,070 --> 00:03:35,537
agents in Rome held an *none?* faction event creating a field
installation in the form of an origami paper crane 

55
00:03:35,834 --> 00:03:38,194
the symbol for the atomic
catastrophe in Japan 

56
00:03:38,882 --> 00:03:43,813
nearly 25 agents were involved including AB and C

57
00:03:45,298 --> 00:03:52,981
In Maryland, agents A B C and others created a
heart-shaped field art installation

58
00:03:53,066 --> 00:03:56,758
over a hospital where their friend agent P was recovering

59
00:03:57,100 --> 00:04:05,682
in Malay agents neutralized the portals and held the 24
hour remembers for agent @moyameehaa
who went missing suddenly one year ago

60
00:04:05,806 --> 00:04:09,724
in India resistance agents conducted
operation Preamble

61
00:04:09,782 --> 00:04:13,213
a layered field up
controlling one point six billion MU

62
00:04:13,305 --> 00:04:17,934
in honor of agent 1855 who passed away
last year in March

63
00:04:17,968 --> 00:04:20,359
nearly fifty agents were involved in the operation

64
00:04:20,481 --> 00:04:25,203
planned by agents A B and C among others

65
00:04:27,092 --> 00:04:32,810
three European ingress agents A B and C

66
00:04:32,841 --> 00:04:39,275
have been traveling across China Mongolia and
Russia on the Trans Mongolian and Trans Siberian Railway

67
00:04:41,741 --> 00:04:44,733
along the way they've been conducting cross action meet up

68
00:04:44,852 --> 00:04:48,028
and exploring the cultures and communities they had been
passing through

69
00:05:02,834 --> 00:05:07,462
their journey which will last one month
has already taken them through Shanghai
and Beijing

70
00:05:07,528 --> 00:05:13,787
and they'll be completing their trip with meet up
 in Moscow on Aug 15th and
st. Petersburg on Aug 18th

71
00:05:14,056 --> 00:05:18,216
In Toulouse enlightened agents launched operation Cremaillere

72
00:05:18,459 --> 00:05:27,239
a field *operation?* involved the creation of a
mind-boggling 796 fields and the control
718 million mind units

73
00:05:27,735 --> 00:05:34,431
over 25 agents were involved
including A B C and D

74
00:05:35,296 --> 00:05:42,821
in Argentina and Uruguay
20 resistance agents including A B C and D

75
00:05:42,831 --> 00:05:47,904
helped conduct a layered field operation 
that control over 120 million mind unit

76
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:50,249
separated across nine separate layers

77
00:05:50,949 --> 00:05:55,240
in July a rare astronomical phenomenon
known as a blue moon occurred

78
00:05:55,468 --> 00:05:59,871
to celebrate it resistance agents in Italy launched
Operation Blue Moon

79
00:06:00,246 --> 00:06:08,837
activating over 300 agents in 30 regions and creating level 8 portals
big *axx* fields and field art installations

80
00:06:08,999 --> 00:06:13,040
over 50 million mind units were controled over the
*course* of the operation

81
00:06:13,627 --> 00:06:18,914
not to be outdone enlightened agents used the 8th
of August International Cat Day

82
00:06:19,107 --> 00:06:24,869
for launch Operation Felidae and celebrate the cat
as a symbol of the enlightened faction

83
00:06:25,486 --> 00:06:32,015
agents in nineteen cities joined the forces
in the creation of over 20 field art installations and several p8 farms

84
00:06:32,445 --> 00:06:34,920
agents also collected founds for cats shelters

85
00:06:35,503 --> 00:06:41,571
So far sitreps from Chile China the Philippines Russia Scotland
Spain and Sweden have emerged 

86
00:06:41,707 --> 00:06:44,719
in July in nagano japan a cross-faction contingent

87
00:06:44,996 --> 00:06:52,114
of 126 agents worked tirelessly to care as several
square mile area of links field and
high-level portals

88
00:06:52,199 --> 00:06:55,978
in order to create a canvas for Operation BlueGreenPlanet

89
00:06:56,489 --> 00:07:00,980
their field art installation was a beautiful
and detailed rendition of planted Earth

90
00:07:01,887 --> 00:07:09,462
agent A B and C have been traveling across Europe
seeking the most powerful XM sources
along their way

91
00:07:09,518 --> 00:07:14,148
 in a modified vehicle inspired by the NIA's NL 1331

92
00:07:14,710 --> 00:07:19,908
their journey so far has taken them to
Berlin Dresden Vienna Mannheim and Paris

93
00:07:19,912 --> 00:07:21,369
where they've met with the local
communities

94
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:25,124
and explore the city's by completing large numbers of missions

95
00:07:25,585 --> 00:07:28,078
 on August 1st nearly three thousand agents

96
00:07:28,234 --> 00:07:33,176
in 90 cities participated in agent organized ingress first Saturdays

97
00:07:33,515 --> 00:07:40,739
agent solved puzzles to decrypt postcodes
gained *472* levels and over 300 million AP

98
00:07:40,850 --> 00:07:46,571
as well as walked over 7600 kilometers
nearly the distance from London to Beijing

99
00:07:46,748 --> 00:07:51,074
keep an eye out for information on the next Ingress first
saturday on September 5th

100
00:07:52,256 --> 00:07:57,534
on the 22nd of August agents will be able to
participate in an official mission day in Paris 

101
00:07:57,843 --> 00:08:02,492
with curated missions developed
in coordination with the Paris Tourism Authority 

102
00:08:02,536 --> 00:08:07,010
this will be an incredible opportunity
to discover hidden gems in the City of Light

103
00:08:07,399 --> 00:08:10,518
RSVP for the event on the ingress Google+ page

104

agents if you have a sitrep you want to share, intel the
demands our attention 

105
00:08:15,696 --> 00:08:17,699

sharing with us on Google+ and Facebook using the hashtag #ingress 

107
00:08:22,577 --> 00:08:26,292
finally I want to share that a
trusted source reached out to me

108
00:08:26,428 --> 00:08:29,341
claiming to have more information about
something called abaddon

109
00:08:29,861 --> 00:08:34,738
the source indicated that this may relate directly
to the origins of the Niantic project

110
00:08:35,070 --> 00:08:39,895
i intend to dig deep into this mystery 
I have a feeling I may be headed to Europe

111
00:08:40,297 --> 00:08:43,033
for the Ingress Report I'm susanna Moyar

112
